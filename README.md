# Assignment to Refactor Code

This project involves the refactoring of an original codebase. The original code was created by [marcushoja0108](https://github.com/marcushoja0108).

## Refactor Versions

### Refactor v1

Refactor v1 was carried out as a team effort by:

- [marcushoja0108](https://github.com/marcushoja0108)
- [Chris-sle](https://github.com/Chris-sle)
- [hawwokitty](https://github.com/hawwokitty)
- Emma - link missing
- Alex - link missing

In this version, we split the code into the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, fixed several files, and addressed a few bugs.

### Refactor v2

Refactor v2 was completed by me. In this version, I updated the code to use modern JavaScript practices and incorporated Bootstrap for enhanced styling.
